# Mini-Adventure
An adaptation of Peter Killworth's "Mini" adventure from "How To Write Adventure Games for the BBC Microcomputer Model B and Acorn Electron" (1984), implemented in Inform 7.

MINI is a small (four-room) text adventure written using the Inform 7 interactive fiction authoring tool.

The game design - the map, objects, and puzzles - is based on an example game presented in Peter Killworth's "How To Write Adventure Games for the BBC Microcomputer Model B and Acorn Electron" (1984).

I (Terry Boon) used the design, and adapted and implemented it in the Inform 7 authoring tool as a first experiment with the language.

(For clarity, responsibility for any errors or issues is naturally mine - Peter Killworth has no involvement beyond writing his excellent book 30+ years ago.)
